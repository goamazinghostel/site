<p>#storytime ... there were a couple of backpackers sitting in Kathmandu and
thinking of opening a hostel in Goa, India. Oh boy. They were facing some
struggles and hurdles but what can you do when they're composed of a German and
Guatemalan. Well, they got together, combined their knowledge of travelling to
more than 70 countries and staying in over 150 hostels, to bring to you the best
backpacking experience!</p>
